### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a research scientist at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) and a Ph.D. student at the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Lab at the Technical University of Darmstadt. My research navigates the rapidly evolving landscape of trustworthy generative AI, tackling critical challenges in AI safety, security, and privacy. I'm particularly focused on adversarial machine learning, where I uncover vulnerabilities in models and design novel defenses against emerging threats.

I also make it a point to share all source codes, promoting transparency and allowing others to build upon my findings. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or encounter challenges â€” whether itâ€™s a discussion, a joint research project, or a GitHub issue, Iâ€™m always open to collaboration.
