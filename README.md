### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. student at the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Lab at TU Darmstadt. My research interests lie in the privacy and security of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning systems.

As AI becomes more widespread and is used in critical areas such as autonomous driving, medical applications, or the financial sector, the security of the model and the privacy of training data play a crucial role. In my work, I study various attacks on machine learning models to understand and mitigate the resulting threats to safety and privacy.

I usally provide all source code required to reproduce research and build upon it. If you have any questions or stumble over any problem, feel free to reach out to me or open an issue on Github.
